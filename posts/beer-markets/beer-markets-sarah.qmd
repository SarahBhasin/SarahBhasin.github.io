Let's analyze the `beer_markets` data:

```{r}
beer_markets <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets_all.csv")
```

## Variable Description for `beer_market` data.frame

# Introduction

About this project: The consumption of beer and alcohol is popular throughout the United States. Because of this, a lot of jobs and lives of Americans revolve around this product. This data frame offers a lot of information about that beer market, and it is important to analyze it in order to draw conclusions about business strategies and real-world conclusions.

<br><br>

The Problem: How can this data frame be beneficial to companies attempting to enter the market force?

# Data

The data.frame 'beer_markets' shows us purchase history of alcoholic beverages around the United States and what the buyers have in terms of income, stability, and family.


# Summary Statistics

```{r}
#| results: asis
#| echo: false
rmarkdown::paged_table(beer_markets) 
```


```{r}
skim(beer_markets) |>  
  select(-n_missing)
```

## Cable Analysis 

To begin, it's important to understand the target market of beer consumers. Whether or not a lot of beer consumers invest in cable can tell us about their habits around tv. 


```{r}
premium_cable_analysis <- beer_markets |>
  group_by(tvcable) |>
  summarise(avg_beer_purchases = mean(quantity))


ggplot(data = premium_cable_analysis, aes(x = tvcable, y = avg_beer_purchases, fill = tvcable)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Beer Purchases by TV Cable Subscription Type",
       x = "TV Cable Subscription",
       y = "Average Beer Purchases",
       fill = "TV Cable Subscription") +
  theme_minimal()
```


There is a slight increase in purchases from consumers who have premium cable, but the data is close enough for me to say that there may not be a significant difference. Therefore, with this information, it is hard to say if having cable/watching cable has a big association with beer purchases. 


# Price Sensitivity

It's important to know if households are sensitive to price change when pricing a product. To reduce risk, one should analyze consumer price sensitivity before making big price adjustments. 

```{r}
price_sensitivity <- beer_markets |>
  mutate(price_per_ounce = dollar_spent / beer_floz)

ggplot(data = price_sensitivity, aes(x = price_per_ounce, y = quantity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Price Sensitivity Analysis",
       x = "Price per Fluid Ounce",
       y = "Quantity Purchased") +
  theme_minimal()
```
As we can see, as quantity increases, price per fluid ounce decreases. Because of this negative relation, we can say that consumers are price sensitive. 


```{r}
ggplot(beer_markets, aes(x = dollar_spent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "Black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Dollar Spent on Beer",
       x = "Dollar Spent",
       y = "Frequency")
```
As we can see, the distribution is skewed right, meaning that consumers are spending a lower amount of dollars on beer. With this information, companies can understand that higher pricing is not a good strategy. Since consumers prefer to pay lower, employing discounts/low prices is a better strategy.

## State and brand 

Understanding which states and brand yield high quantities in the purchase of beer can help companies understand popular locations for beer as well as the main brand competitors in the locations. 


```{r}
state_total <- beer_markets |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity))
highest_consumption <- state_total |>
  arrange(desc(total_quantity)) |>
  slice(1:5)

ggplot(highest_consumption, aes(x = state, y = total_quantity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Total Beer Consumption by State",
       x = "State",
       y = "Total Quantity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

```
The visualizations above depicts the total quantity of beer purchased in the 5 states with the highest quantity of beer purchased.This shows which states tend to be buy more beer, an important thing for a beer company to know when allocating their marketing efforts and resources. According to the bar chart, Florida is the state with the highest quantity of beer purchased.A company may use this knowledge to allocate more inventory to warehouses in Florida/tailor their marketing efforts to those in Florida.  

Next, we want to see the most popular beer brands in the U.S. across all states by their quantity

```{r}
state_brand_total <- beer_markets|>
  group_by(state, brand) |>
  summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(desc(total_quantity))

# Calculate total beer consumption by brand across all states (national level)
national_brand_total <- state_brand_total |>
  group_by(brand) |>
  summarise(total_quantity_national = sum(total_quantity)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(desc(total_quantity_national))

ggplot(national_brand_total, aes(x = reorder(brand, total_quantity_national), y = total_quantity_national)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow") +
  labs(title = "National Total Quantity by Brand",
       x = "Brand",
       y = "Total Quantity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

```
This chart shows the top 5 brands that yield the most demand across all states. As we can see, Bud Light is the beer brand in this data set with the highest quantity purchased across all the states. In other words, Bud Light is a top competitor in the American beer market. 

Additionally, the state_brand_total data frame shows us the top beer companies in the top 5 states provided earlier. The results are
Florida: Natural Light
Texas: Natural Light
California: Bud Light
Ohio: Miller lite 
North Carolina: Bud Light 

This will tell a company interested in entering those specific states (which are the top 5 states that purchased the most beer) who their top competitors will be. 


## Promotion and dollar_spent

Understanding whether promotions for beers are successful in sales-- dollar spent by consumers-- is important for businesses who are looking for new marketing strategies. In the following data frame, we will see if promotions yield higher dollar_spent, and if so, which demographic of people are purchasing? 

```{r}
promo_dollar <- beer_markets |>
filter(!is.na(promo))

promo_dollar_spent <- promo_dollar |>
group_by(promo) |>
summarize(avg_dollar_spent = mean(dollar_spent))

promo_response <- promo_dollar |>
  group_by(promo,buyertype, age) |>
  summarise(avg_dollar_spent = mean(dollar_spent)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_dollar_spent))

ggplot(promo_response, aes(x = age, y = avg_dollar_spent, fill = promo)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Dollar Spent by Promotion Type and Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Average Dollar Spent",
       fill = "Promotion Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  facet_wrap(~ buyertype)
```
This visualization shows that there were more purchases of beer (higher average dollar spent for the households) made on promotion than not on promotion. We can see that promotions are beneficial to the sale of beer. Additionally, for beers on promotion, males aged under 30 and aged 40-49 have the highest average dollar spent on beer than the other demographic groups. This information can help beer companies understand that promotions yield benefits in sales, and that young and middle ages males are their best customers for promotions.

## Container analysis 

When researching the beer market, it's important to ask:
What are the most popular container types for purchasing beer?

```{r}
# Aggregate beer purchases by container type
container_distribution <- beer_markets |>
  group_by(container) |>
  summarise(total_purchases = n())

# Calculate percentage of purchases for each container type
container_distribution$percentage <- container_distribution$total_purchases / sum(container_distribution$total_purchases) * 100

ggplot(data = container_distribution, aes(x = container, y = percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Beer Purchases by Container Type",
       x = "Container Type",
       y = "Percentage of Purchases") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
As you can see, most of the beers that are purchased are can. This tells us a lot about our target market, specifically that they prefer cans. This can be for majority of reasons, one being that they are easily disposable. Can types being most popular also may tell a researcher that a lot of beers are used for parties. Overall, a company can use this information to change their product design to best fit consumer needs. 

## Conclusion 

Understanding competition, target markets, trends, and demographics are important to mitigate risk when entering an industry. This data frame allows for insight into the Beer industry, and is useful data for a market researcher interested in taking decision-filled-steps to better their company.
